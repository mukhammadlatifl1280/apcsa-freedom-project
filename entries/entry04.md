### Context

During the past few weeks I have gained more knowledge of learning my tool SwiftUI. I have visited several links on how to use the tool for beginners. For example I have searched specifically "how to use swift UI to connect to other pages" then I visited examples through github websites. This brought me to the swiftUI tutorials and youtube videos on how to make buttons and connect them to another page and I scrolled through to read and how to use it. The examples from github explained thoroughly on the basic steps on how to use functions using another page of SwiftUI. After watching the examples and tutorials, I finally managed to make something that works. As I didn't know what they all meant, I found the swiftUI installation procedure to be incredibly confusing as there were so many functions to pick from. As I am learning a brand-new programming language, I would have to start from scratch and gradually improve my knowledge.

### Process

To show the UI of swift how I managed to connect the pages this is the example that I did below:

Now in order to show how this all worked I will briefly explain using the images below:
