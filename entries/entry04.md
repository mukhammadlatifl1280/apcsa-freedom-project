### Context

During the past few weeks I have gained more knowledge of learning my tool SwiftUI. I have visited several links on how to use the tool for beginners. For example I have searched specifically "how to use swift UI to connect to other pages" then I visited examples through github websites. This brought me to the swiftUI tutorials and youtube videos on how to make buttons and connect them to another page and I scrolled through to read and how to use it. The examples from github explained thoroughly on the basic steps on how to use functions using another page of SwiftUI. After watching the examples and tutorials, I finally managed to make something that works. As I didn't know what they all meant, I found the swiftUI installation procedure to be incredibly confusing as there were so many functions to pick from. As I am learning a brand-new programming language, I would have to start from scratch and gradually improve my knowledge.

### Process

To show the UI of swift how I managed to connect the pages this is the example that I did below:

Now in order to show how this all worked I will briefly demonstrate how the UI works in this video:

*Note in order to watch this tutorial video you would need to click on the file and download the raw version

To highlight what I gained knowledge from learning that function gave me so many new possibilities because at first I was stuck with one page and now that I learned to create new different pages, this would allow me to go further on my beyond MVP. One example of an beyond MVP that I am thinking is different tax forms such as 1099 based on the person's information by asking questions. Based on user's answer it will bring to certain page that will tell how much they have to pay for taxes.

### Engineering Design Process[(EDP)](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

Planning, designing, creating, testing, and then improving are the seven steps of the engineering design process (EDP). As a result, the process never ends because there are always methods to make your design better. I intend to enable both testing and user feedback in order to make improvements. I'm now testing at stage 6 and 7 which is test and plan. In terms of aim, my "Tax Calculator App" project will contain features that improve quality of life and make taxation simpler and more programmable. However, in terms of a Minimum Viable Product, I simply need to write a program that accepts user input, processes that information, and then outputs the outcome. Although I have accomplished user input and output, I still think there are some small things left before the MVP is fully finished.

### Skills
The skill I gained was that I got better at learning what I am looking for. I think I am proficient at researching on my tool since I discovered many things about swift just by searching examples on github, looking for videos, visiting links to tutorials etc. Coding is made more efficient and simple in many ways, but it may be made much simpler if you know what you're doing. Specifically, I have learned how to connect pages with another and got exposed on how the UI really works and I would need to do more research on other functions of the UI so that I gain more knowledge on my tool.
