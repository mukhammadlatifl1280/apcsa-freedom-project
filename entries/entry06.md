# Entry 6
##### 06/06/23

### Context
After successfully completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), my partner and I were inspired to take our project even further. I decided to add a separate page to calculate property tax, but unfortunately, I encountered some difficulties and couldn't complete it. However, I did make some changes to the visual design by updating the colors. I got some ideas from my classmates and incorporated them into the color scheme.

Continuing beyond the MVP stage, my friends and I attended a SEP expo on May 24th. We had the opportunity to present our year-long project to a panel of judges, showcasing our progress and achievements. Additionally, we individually presented our projects to our class and teacher, explaining the process we followed and the valuable lessons we learned along the way. It was a great opportunity to showcase our hard work and the skills we developed through this assignment.

Due to time constraints, I found it challenging to adequately prepare for the presentation, resulting in a subpar delivery of my product. However, despite my shortcomings, the judges acknowledged and rewarded my high level of creativity, which indicates that my creative skills are highly developed, leaving only a few areas for improvement. I realized that I should have stood up and presented instead of sitting at the table, as it caused the presentation to drag on. This experience has taught me a valuable lesson, and I am determined to perform better in future presentations, especially as I enter my college year.

Comparing my performance in this section of the presentation to the expo presentation, it seemed that I presented better and received a higher mark. While there are still several areas where I can improve my presentation skills, I also achieved positive outcomes. In terms of the positives, I believe I effectively explained my code and methodology and utilized visuals to support my points. However, I recognized the need to work on creating a captivating hook at the beginning and delivering a strong conclusion. This presentation has taught me numerous valuable lessons throughout the demanding and challenging Freedom Project journey.

### Engineering Design Process

I've reached step 8 of the EDP, which involves communicating the results, and I have successfully completed all the previous stages. To effectively communicate the results, I need to showcase the outcomes of my project and explain how I acquired knowledge about Firebase. While there are multiple ways to improve my project, I have gained valuable insights from the significant errors I made. Looking ahead, I am confident that I will not repeat the same mistakes and will strive to perform better the next time I find myself in a similar situation.

### Skills

Through the Freedom Project, I have had the opportunity to develop a range of new skills that have been invaluable to me. One significant area of growth has been in personal organization and time management. These skills are not only highly useful but also essential for success. Additionally, my presentation abilities and personal management skills have significantly improved. I have learned the importance of maintaining focus on my assignments and not letting distractions seep into my mind. It has been effective for me to review the material or instructions first, take a break, and then approach the task with a fresh perspective. Furthermore, I have discovered the significance of being enthusiastic, humble, and maintaining eye contact during presentations. I now understand that making eye contact is a sign of confidence and have learned to incorporate this practice into my presentations. Overall, the Freedom Project has been a valuable learning experience that has equipped me with important skills and insights for future endeavors.
