# Entry 2
##### 12/15/22


During the past few weeks I have gained some knowledge of learning my tool SwiftUI. I have visited several links on how to use the tool for beginners. For example I have searched specifically "how to use swift UI" then I visited this [website](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui). This brought me to the swiftUI tutorials and basics functions(i.e. How to create static labels with a Text view) and I scrolled through to read and how to use it. I also browse through some videos for examples and tutorials on basics about SwiftUI. The video explained thoroughly on the basic steps on how to use functions of SwiftUI. After watching many videos, I finally managed to make something that works. During the process of installing the swiftUI I noticed there was many functions to choose from which was very overwhelming because I didn't understand what they meant. Since I am learning a completely new programming language, I would have to start from the scrath and build my knowledege as I keep learning.

## Process

So far this is one thing I made with SwiftUI:

The swift code above shows many different types of functions such as booleans, private variable and Vstack which allows you to stack views vertically, from top to bottom. You can further customize the view by adding alignment or spacing to the VStack as you can see in the example I made above. The preview of that code would show this in the bottom:

After getting this step done, I have accomplished something and got a little sense of how SwiftUI works. In my opinion, Swift seems to be easier as compared with Java because Swift uses a simple and expressive syntax that is easy to understand, even if you do not have any prior experience with coding.

## Engineering Design Process [(EDP)](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

Planning, designing, creating, testing, and then improving are the seven steps of the engineering design process (EDP). As a result, the process never ends because there are always methods to make your design better. I intend to enable both testing and user feedback in order to make improvements. I'm now testing at stage 2. In terms of aim, my "Tax Calculator App" project will contain features that improve quality of life and make taxation simpler and more programmable. However, in terms of a Minimum Viable Product, I simply need to write a program that accepts user input, processes that information, and then outputs the outcome.

## Skills

During this past week, the skill I gained was that I got better at researching what I am looking for. I think I am proficient at researching on my tool since I discovered many things about swift just by watching youtube videos, visiting links to tutorials etc. Over the upcoming winter break, I intend to dedicate all of my free time to learning Swift. Swift is user-friendly, but that does not mean you can just dive in, in my opinion after first observations. Coding is made more efficient and simple in many ways, but it may be made much simpler if you know what you're doing. I've put up a short playlist with materials to help meÂ learn Swfit. Additionally, I'll focus on how to take user input using a text box and a button, process it, and do something with it.
