During the past few weeks I have gained more knowledge of learning my tool SwiftUI. I have visited several links on how to use the tool for beginners. For example I have searched specifically "how to use swift UI to make front end examples" then I visited examples through github websites. This brought me to the [swiftUI tutorials](https://github.com/mrcflorian/swiftUI-tutorials) and basics functions(i.e. How to use Firebase with swiftUI) and I scrolled through to read and how to use it. I also browse through some examples and tutorials on basics about SwiftUI. The examples from github explained thoroughly on the basic steps on how to use functions of SwiftUI. After watching the examples and tutorials, I finally managed to make something that works. During the process of installing the swiftUI I noticed there was many functions to choose from which was very overwhelming because I didn't understand what they meant. Since I am learning a completely new programming language, I would have to start from the scrath and build my knowledege as I keep learning.
