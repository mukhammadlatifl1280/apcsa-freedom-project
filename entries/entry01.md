### Context 

During this year I will be learning about a tool of a computer engineering which is called [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). SwiftUI is a software language developer app that is a new way to build user interfaces for apps on Apple platforms. It allows developers to define the UI using Swift code. I will be using this tool to make an app that will calcualte the income tax of how much the user will be paying at th end of the year based on users input. I have decided to use SwiftUI because I believe it is very helpful for my application to store data inside and able to run the app in iPhone. Throughout the year, I will also be learning how the Swift language works and then start to code my project. The application that I will be using to run my code is called [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Xcode is an apple applicationwhich can only run on macbook or macOS engine.
### Skills
As far as I can tell, I am pretty good at math and my project will require tremendous math problems that I will be facing, so as a result one of my skills is that I am proficient at math. Another skill I have is keeping track of time on what I will be doing and planning everything before I do the problem. Overall for skills the most important thing I learned was don't be afraid or to hesitate to ask any questions about anything that I think is important. For now I will learn more about the SwiftUI and the languages of SwiftUI, then I will put the best of my ability to create a proper blueprint to then test it then we will make corrections that we put out the best we can provide from myself.

### EDP
For the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) I am currently in **step 1** since I am in the process of finding, and defining my problem. Additionally, I am in the process where I will be learning about my tool [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) which would take most of my time going through this Freedom Project. My plan for the next process is to first have an idea of what I should be doing first, such as planning my things on specific days to stay organized.
