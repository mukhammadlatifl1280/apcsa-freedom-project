## Implications

Creating a free and easy-to-use tax calculator app could help people handle their taxes more effectively. Many existing tax calculators online either charge money or show annoying ads, which can be frustrating. By developing a user-friendly app that doesn't cost anything, individuals would have a handy tool to calculate their taxes accurately and quickly. This would give them a better understanding of their financial responsibilities, allowing them to make smarter decisions and plan their taxes better. With this app, people can manage their money with confidence, follow tax rules correctly, and potentially save more money. By making taxes simpler and more accessible, this app would contribute to improving people's financial knowledge and overall economic well-being.
